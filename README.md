# Razor client

This code is still in development mode; that means that we might make
backwards incompatible changes, especially to the database schema which
would force you to rebuild all the machines that Razor is managing. Razor
will become stable RSN.

This is the command line client for the
[Razor server](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server) Please have a
look at the Wiki over there for details.
